## Plant response to radiation

\
The response of plants to ionizing radiation has been well categorized in studies principally using Arabidopsis thaliana as the model (e.g., Culligan et al., 2006 and Missiran et al., 2014 and Bourbousse et al., 2018). For example, HZE radiation has previously been shown to induce transcriptional responses shared with plant reactions to a wide range of other stresses such as high light and salt. Molecular genetic analysis has further characterized a cascade of events related to HZE-triggered DNA damage repair through classic signalling cascades such as the ATR and ATM kinases acting on the SOG1 response regulator. Manion et al., (2021) used publicly available data in GeneLab ([GLDS-7](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-7/),[ GLDS-37](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-37/),[ GLDS-38](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-38/),[ GLDS-46](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-46/), and[ GLDS-120](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-120/)) and these models of ATR/ATM regulation to identify a double-stranded DNA repair network that was modified in spaceflight in plants that experienced increased ionizing radiation. Thus, from even these limited terrestrial plant radiation studies, response networks relevant to extraterrestrial radiation sources are beginning to be revealed and molecular targets for potential radiation countermeasures through marker-assisted breeding or targeted genome editing are identified. However, currently, there are very few plant ionizing radiation studies, making key insights that can e.g., be translated into crop improvements for long haul spaceflight a major challenge. The main restriction to progress in this area is the limited access to sources to ionizing radiation delivering exposures comparable to space. Plant biology is thought to be relatively radiation-resistant but we do not know how plants respond when ionizing radiation is delivered at the low but sustained levels that mimic the exposures of spaceflight. Plants are also highly environmentally sensitive, integrating multiple stimuli to drive appropriate physiology and development. To understand how ionizing radiation affects plant biology in space it then becomes critical to test this stress in conjunction with other factors found within spacecraft/habitats that are also key determinants of plant function. Elevated CO2, reduced O2, and the lack of a gravitational vector all likely modify plant radiation responses in spaceflight but to currently undefined extents. At present facilities to make these critical measurements throughout the extended periods of the plant life cycle do not exist.
